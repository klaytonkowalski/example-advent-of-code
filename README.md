# Advent of Code

Example of "Advent of Code" solutions written in Lua.

Each problem has two parts. Sometimes the code between them is completely rewritten because the problem itself changes drastically. The code is somewhat commented, but if something if not clear enough, please let me know and I will be happy to explain. Solving the problems took priority over non-critical metrics like efficiency or performance.
