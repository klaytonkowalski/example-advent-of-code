# Advent of Code

Example of "Advent of Code" solutions written in Lua.

Each problem has two parts. Sometimes the code between them is completely rewritten because the problem itself changes drastically. The code is commented enough such that an experienced Lua programmer can understand all solutions. Solving the problems took priority over non-critical metrics like efficiency or performance.
